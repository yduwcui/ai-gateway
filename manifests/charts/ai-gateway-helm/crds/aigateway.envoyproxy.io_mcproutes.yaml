          MCPRoute defines how to route MCP requests to the backend MCP servers.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" AI API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single schema API to interact with multiple MCP backends.

                  BackendRefs is a list of backend references to the MCP servers.
                  These MCP servers will be aggregated and exposed as a single MCP endpoint to the clients.
                  From the client's perspective, they only need to configure a single MCP server URL, e.g. "https://api.example.com/mcp",
                  and the Envoy AI Gateway will route the requests to the appropriate MCP server based on the requests.

                  All names must be unique within this list to avoid potential tools, resources, etc. name collisions.
                  Also, cross-namespace references are not supported. In other words, the backend MCP servers must be in the
                  same namespace as the MCPRoute.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:

                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.

                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                        any namespace to the Service.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                        ParentRef of the Route.

                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port

                        must match both specified values.

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
