          AIGatewayRoute combines multiple AIServiceBackends and attaching them to Gateway(s) resources.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" AI API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single schema API to interact with multiple AI backends.

          The schema field is used to determine the structure of the requests that the Gateway will
          receive. And then the Gateway will route the traffic to the appropriate AIServiceBackend based
          on the output schema of the AIServiceBackend while doing the other necessary jobs like
          upstream authentication, rate limit, etc.

          Envoy AI Gateway will generate the following k8s resources corresponding to the AIGatewayRoute:

            - HTTPRoute of the Gateway API as a top-level resource to bind all backends.
              The name of the HTTPRoute is the same as the AIGatewayRoute.
            - EnvoyExtensionPolicy of the Envoy Gateway API to attach the AI Gateway filter into the target Gateways.
              This will be created per Gateway, and its name is `ai-eg-eep-${gateway-name}`.
            - HTTPRouteFilter of the Envoy Gateway API per namespace for automatic hostname rewrite.
              The name of the HTTPRouteFilter is `ai-eg-host-rewrite`.

          All of these resources are created in the same namespace as the AIGatewayRoute. Note that this is the implementation
          detail subject to change. If you want to customize the default behavior of the Envoy AI Gateway, you can use these
          resources as a reference and create your own resources. Alternatively, you can use EnvoyPatchPolicy API of the Envoy
          Gateway to patch the generated resources. For example, you can configure the retry fallback behavior by attaching
          BackendTrafficPolicy API of Envoy Gateway to the generated HTTPRoute.

                  FilterConfig is the configuration for the AI Gateway filter inserted in the generated HTTPRoute.

                  An AI Gateway filter is responsible for the transformation of the request and response
                  as well as the routing behavior based on the model name extracted from the request content, etc.

                  Currently, the filter is only implemented as an external processor filter, which might be
                  extended to other types of filters in the future. See https://github.com/envoyproxy/ai-gateway/issues/90

                          AIGatewayRoute has a different resource configuration, the ai-gateway will pick one of them
                          to configure the resource requirements of the external processor container.

                  Each rule is a subset of the HTTPRoute in the Gateway API (https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/).

                  AI Gateway controller will generate a HTTPRoute based on the configuration given here with the additional
                  modifications to achieve the necessary jobs, notably inserting the AI Gateway filter responsible for
                  the transformation of the request and response, etc.

                  In the matching conditions in the AIGatewayRouteRule, `x-ai-eg-model` header is available
                  if we want to describe the routing behavior based on the model name. The model name is extracted
                  from the request content before the routing decision.

                  How multiple rules are matched is the same as the Gateway API. See for the details:

                        The namespace of each backend is "local", i.e. the same namespace as the AIGatewayRoute.

                        By configuring multiple backends, you can achieve the fallback behavior in the case of
                        the primary backend is not available combined with the BackendTrafficPolicy of Envoy Gateway.

                            sent from the gateway to when the full response has been received from the backend.

                            Setting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. "0s") SHOULD disable the timeout
                            completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST

              schema:
                description: |-
                  APISchema specifies the API schema of the input that the target Gateway(s) will receive.
                  Based on this schema, the ai-gateway will perform the necessary transformation to the
                  output schema specified in the selected AIServiceBackend during the routing process.

                  Currently, the only supported schema is OpenAI as the input schema.

                    description: |-
                      Version is the version of the API schema.

                      When the name is set to "OpenAI", this equals to the prefix of the OpenAI API endpoints. This defaults to "v1"
                      if not set or empty string. For example, "chat completions" API endpoint will be "/v1/chat/completions"
                      if the version is set to "v1".

                      This is especially useful when routing to the backend that has an OpenAI compatible API but has a different
                      versioning scheme. For example, Gemini OpenAI compatible API (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) uses
                      "/v1beta/openai" version prefix. Another example is that Cohere AI (https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/compatibility-api)
                      uses "/compatibility/v1" version prefix. On the other hand, DeepSeek (https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) doesn't
                      use version prefix, so the version can be set to an empty string.

                      When the name is set to AzureOpenAI, this version maps to "API Version" in the
                      Azure OpenAI API documentation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning).
