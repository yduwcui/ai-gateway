# Notes on Releases

## Release Cycles

Since Envoy AI Gateway depends on the Envoy Gateway and Envoy Proxy, we will follow the release cycle of the Envoy Gateway.

In other words, we aim to cut the release of the Envoy AI Gateway a few days or a week after the new version of the Envoy Gateway is released. Therefore, the release cycle of the Envoy AI Gateway will be approximately every 2-3 months.

We increment the major version number when we have a major architectural change or a major feature addition.

Especially when we have a first stable control plane API, we will cut the major v1.0.0 release. Until then, we will use the version number v0.3.x, v0.4.y, etc. See the [support policy](#Support-Policy) for more details.

The patch version will be incremented when we have a bug fix or a security fix. The end of life for the version will be 2 releases after the release of the version. For example, if we release the version v0.1.0, the end of life for the version will be when we release the version v0.3.0.

The main branch will always use the latest version of the Envoy Gateway, hence the latest version of the Envoy, and the main version will be available just like the tagged released versions in the Docker Hub where we also host the helm chart.

## Support Policy

This document focuses on compatibility concerns of those using Envoy AI Gateway.
It is important to note that the support policy is subject to change at any time. The support policy is as follows:

First of all, there are four areas of compatibility that we are concerned with:
* [Using envoyproxy/ai-gateway as a Go package](#public-go-package).
* [Deploying the Envoy AI Gateway controller through the Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](#Custom-Resource-Definitions).
* [Upgrading the Envoy AI Gateway controller](#Upgrading-the-Envoy-AI-Gateway-controller).
* [Envoy Gateway vs Envoy AI Gateway compatibility](#Envoy-Gateway-vs-Envoy-AI-Gateway-compatibility).

### Public Go package

Since we do not envision this repository ends up as a transitive dependency, i.e. only used as a direct dependency such as in a custom control plane, etc., we assume that any consumer of the project should have the full control over the source code depending on the project. This allows us to declare deprecation and introduce the breaking changes in the version after the next one since they can migrate the code at their discretion. For example, any public API that is marked as deprecated in the version N will be removed in the version N+2. We document how users should migrate to the new API will be documented in the release notes if applicable, but we do not guarantee that the migration path will be provided.

### Custom Resource Definitions

The Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are defined in api/${version}/*.go files. The CRDs are versioned as v1alpha1, v1alpha2, etc.

**For alpha versions**, we simply employ the same deprecation policy as the Go package. In other words, the APIs will be marked as deprecated in the version N and will be removed in the version N+2 but without any guarantee of migration path.

Migration paths for alpha versions will be the best effort and will be documented in the release notes.
**For beta versions**, For beta versions, it is the same as the alpha versions, but we will provide a migration path in the release notes.

**For stable versions**, we will never break the APIs unless there is a critical security issue.
We will provide a migration path in the release notes in case we need to break the APIs.

### Upgrading the Envoy AI Gateway controller

We guarantee that simply upgrading the controller will not break the existing configuration assuming there's no _un-migrated_ resources including breaking change left in the k8s API server. In other words, after the proper use of the API and migration path described above, the user should be able to upgrade the controller without any issue. However, this does mean that we do NOT guarantee that the existing configuration will work across more than two version of the controller. For example if you are using the version N of the controller, and you want to upgrade to the version N+2, you should first upgrade to the version N+1 while following the migration path if applicable, and then upgrade to the version N+2.

### Envoy Gateway vs Envoy AI Gateway compatibility

Since Envoy AI Gateway is built on top of Envoy Gateway, the compatibility between the two is important.

We use the latest released version of Envoy Gateway as the base of the Envoy AI Gateway when we release a new version.

Since Envoy Gateway is a stable project and supposed to work across versions, we do not expect any compatibility issue as long as the Envoy Gateway version is also up-to-date prior to the upgrade of the Envoy AI Gateway.

## Release Process

This section is for maintainers of the project. Let's say we are going to release the version v0.50.0.

### Release Candidate (RC) Phase

Each non-patch release should start with Release Candidate (RC) phase as follows:

1. First, notify the community that we are going to cut the release candidate and therefore the main branch is frozen.
  The main branch should only accept the bug fixes, the security fixes, and documentation changes.
  The release candidate should always be cut from the main branch.

2. Cut the request candidate tag from the main branch. The tag should be v0.50.0-rc1. Assuming the remote `origin` is the main envoyproxy/ai-gateway repository,
  the command to cut the tag is:
    ```
    git fetch origin # make sure you have the latest main branch locally.
    git tag v0.50.0-rc1 origin/main
    git push origin v0.50.0-rc1
    ```
   Pushing a tag will trigger the pipeline to build the release candidate image and the helm chart tagged with the release candidate tag.
   The release candidate image will be available in the Docker Hub.

3. The release candidate should be tested by the maintainers and the community. If there is any issue, the issue should be fixed in the main branch
  and the new rc tag should be created. For example, if there is an issue in the release candidate v0.50.0-rc1, replace `v0.50.0-rc1` with `v0.50.0-rc2`
  in the above command and repeat the process.

### Release Phase

1. Once the release candidate is stable, we will cut the release from the main branch, assuming that's exactly the same as the last release candidate.
  The command to cut the release is exactly the same as the release candidate:
    ```
    git fetch origin # make sure you have the latest main branch locally.
    git tag v0.50.0 origin/main
    git push origin v0.50.0
    ```
   Pushing a tag will trigger the pipeline to build the release image and the helm chart tagged with the release tag.
   The release image will be available in the Docker Hub.
2. The draft release note will be created in the GitHub repository after the pipeline is completed.
   Edit the release note nicely by hand to reflect the changes in the release.
3. Announce the release in the community.
4. Create `release/v0.50` branch from the tag for the future backports, bug fixes, etc.

### Backport Phase

1. If there is a bug fix or a security fix that needs to be backported to the previous release, maintainers should cherry-pick the commit and raise the PR to the `release/v0.50` branch.
   Which commit should be backported is up to the maintainers and on a case-by-case basis.
2. Once the PR is merged, the maintainers will decide when to cut the patch release. There's no need to wait for multiple backports to cut the patch release, etc.
   Do not cut the tag until all CI passes on the release/v0.50 branch.
3. The patch release should be cut from the `release/v0.50` branch. The command to cut the patch release is exactly the same as normal release:
    ```
    git fetch origin # make sure you have the latest release/v0.50 branch locally.
    git tag v0.50.1 origin/release/v0.50
    git push origin v0.50.1
    ```
   Pushing a tag will trigger the pipeline to build the patch release image and the helm chart tagged with the patch release tag.
   The patch release image will be available in the Docker Hub.
4. The draft release note will be created in the GitHub repository after the pipeline is completed.
   Edit the release note nicely by hand to reflect the changes in the release.
5. Update the documentation on the main branch to reflect the new version. This has the following items:
   * Change `v0.50.0` to `v0.50.1` in site/versioned_docs/version-0.50 directory.
   * Update the site/src/pages/release-notes.md to add the new release note.
